### 1. What is .NET?
   
The .NET Framework is a comprehensive software development platform developed by Microsoft. It includes a runtime environment called the Common Language Runtime (CLR) and a rich set of class libraries. It supports multiple programming languages such as C#, VB.NET, and F#, and offers features like memory management, security, and exception handling.

The .NET Framework is primarily used to create applications for Windows, but with the introduction of .NET Core and .NET 5, it can also be used to develop cross-platform applications as well.
