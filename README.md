## .NET
### 1. What is .NET?
   
The .NET Framework is a comprehensive software development platform developed by Microsoft. It includes a runtime environment called the Common Language Runtime (CLR) and a rich set of class libraries. It supports multiple programming languages such as C#, VB.NET, and F#, and offers features like memory management, security, and exception handling.

The .NET Framework is primarily used to create applications for Windows, but with the introduction of .NET Core and .NET 5, it can also be used to develop cross-platform applications as well.

### 2. The Structure of .NET Framework.

### 3. What is Command Language Runtime(CLR)?

The Common Language Runtime (CLR) is the **execution environment** provided by the **.NET Framework**. It manages the **execution** of .NET applications, providing services like **memory management**, **code verification**, **security**, **garbage collection**, and **exception handling**.

One of the key features of the CLR is the **Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler**. When a .NET application is executed, the CLR uses the JIT compiler to **convert the Intermediate Language (IL) code—a low-level**, platform-agnostic programming language—into native machine code specific to the system the application is running on. This process happens at runtime, hence the term "Just-In-Time". This allows .NET applications to be **platform-independent** until they are executed, providing a significant advantage in terms of portability and performance.

### 4. What is ASP .NET?

ASP.NET (Active Server Pages . NET) is a progressive new programming **framework** that empowers the rapid improvement of powerful **web applications and administrations**. It is a part of the Microsoft .NET Platform, it gives the simplest and most versatile approach to **creating, deploying and running web applications** that can focus on any browser or device.ASP.NET is built on the CLR(Common Language Runtime) which allows the programmers to execute its code using any .NET language(C#, VB, etc.). It is specially designed to work with HTTP and for web developers to create dynamic web pages, web applications, websites, and web services as it provides a good integration of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

.NET Framework is used to create a variety of applications and services like Console, Web, and Windows, etc. But ASP.NET is only used to create web applications and web services. That’s why we termed ASP.NET as a subset of the .NET Framework.

### 5. What is ASP .NET Features?
There are a lot of reasons which make ASP.NET popular among developers. Some reasons are listed below:

**Extending .NET Framework**: ASP.NET is a subset of the .NET Framework as it extends the .NET Framework with some libraries and tools to develop web apps. The thing that it adds to the .NET Framework is Libraries for common web patterns like MVC, Editor Extensions, the base framework to process the web requests, and web-page templating syntax like Razor, etc.
**Performance**: It is faster than the other web frameworks available in the market.
**Backend Code**: With the help of ASP.NET you can write the backend code for data access and any logic in C#.
**Dynamic Pages**: In ASP.NET, Razor provides the syntax for developing dynamic web pages with the help of C# and HTML. ASP.NET can be integrated with JavaScript and it also includes the frameworks like React and Angular for the SPA(Single Page Application.)
Supporting different OS: You can develop and execute ASP.NET apps on Windows, Linux, Docker, and macOS. The Visual Studio provides the tools to build .NET apps with different OS.
