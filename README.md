## .NET
### 1. What is .NET?
   
The .NET Framework is a comprehensive software development platform developed by Microsoft. It includes a runtime environment called the Common Language Runtime (CLR) and a rich set of class libraries. It supports multiple programming languages such as C#, VB.NET, and F#, and offers features like memory management, security, and exception handling.

The .NET Framework is primarily used to create applications for Windows, but with the introduction of .NET Core and .NET 5, it can also be used to develop cross-platform applications as well.

### 3. What is Command Language Runtime(CLR)?

The Common Language Runtime (CLR) is the **execution environment** provided by the **.NET Framework**. It manages the **execution** of .NET applications, providing services like **memory management**, **code verification**, **security**, **garbage collection**, and **exception handling**.

One of the key features of the CLR is the **Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler**. When a .NET application is executed, the CLR uses the JIT compiler to **convert the Intermediate Language (IL) code—a low-level**, platform-agnostic programming language—into native machine code specific to the system the application is running on. This process happens at runtime, hence the term "Just-In-Time". This allows .NET applications to be **platform-independent** until they are executed, providing a significant advantage in terms of portability and performance.
